ACCORD Physics evaluation and validation tools

1. DDH: convertDDH.tar.gz (by Marvin Kahnert) contains sample DDH output over Svalbard, and a script to convert it to a single NetCDF file.  The tarball is available at: https://opensource.umr-cnrm.fr/projects/accord/wiki/DDH_workshop_2023.

2. Sample data by Daniel Mart√≠n, along with scripts and a README for plotting tendancies for a point location. The tarball provided at the link below provides enough to get started with in the learning of how to use DDH to plot tendancies. Download this tarball to get started (works on ATOS and other machines): [[https://opensource.umr-cnrm.fr/attachments/5682/ddh_simple.tar.gz]]
